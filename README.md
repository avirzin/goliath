# Goliath

An index-based fund on the blockchain allows investment in a diversified, low-cost portfolio using smart contracts, ensuring transparency and accessibility for people in Brazil and abroad. This project was specially developed for the [Blockchain Rio Hackathon 2024.](https://taikai.network/blockchainrio/hackathons/blockchainriohack24).


## The Problem


This project aimed to solve several key problems faced by individual investors, particularly those seeking long-term growth and financial security.


1. **Lack of Diversification** - Many individual investors struggle to achieve sufficient diversification in their portfolios, exposing themselves to higher risk by concentrating investments in a few stocks or sectors.

2. **High Investment Costs** - High fees and expenses can significantly erode investment returns over time, especially in actively managed funds.

3. **Complexity of Stock Picking** - Choosing individual stocks requires substantial research, time, and expertise, which can be challenging and overwhelming for many investors.

4. **Market Timing Risks** - Trying to time the market—buying low and selling high—is notoriously difficult and often leads to poor investment decisions.

5. **Inconsistent Performance of Actively Managed Funds** - Actively managed funds often fail to consistently outperform the market after accounting for fees, leading to disappointing returns.

6. **Transparency and Trust** Lack of transparency in some investment vehicles can lead to mistrust and uncertainty among investors.

7. **Long-Term Financial Goals** Achieving long-term financial goals such as retirement, education funding, or wealth accumulation requires a disciplined and reliable investment strategy.
